TIC-TAC-TOE

HTML Structure:

The game likely uses HTML elements such as div or span for the boxes (class='box') and other UI elements like buttons and score displays.
JavaScript Logic:

The game logic is handled entirely with vanilla JavaScript. Key functions include:
Changing Turns: Alternates between player "X" and player "O".
Checking for Wins: Validates winning combinations using an array of winning indices.
Handling User Input: Uses event listeners to detect clicks on boxes.
Resetting the Game: Clears the board and resets the game state.
Audio Management:

Audio feedback is included for actions like clicking and winning.
DOM Manipulation:

The code makes extensive use of document.getElementById and document.getElementsByClassName to manipulate the UI dynamically.
